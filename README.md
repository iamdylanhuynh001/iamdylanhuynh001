### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Dylan!!!
My name is Dylan and I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's of Computer Science.  As of right now, I enjoy playing the game [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) and trying out [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home).  I'm not so sure which field of software engineering I want to pursue, so I'm exploring all of my options.
